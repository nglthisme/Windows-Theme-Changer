# Windows-Theme-Changer
I am working on a tool that automatically changes the Windows 11 theme.

My android phone has an option to automatically switch between dark and light mode at a scheduled time, but Windows is lacking in that area. 
I made an app that applies one of three default Windows themes in the morning for light mode, and one of three dark mode themes in the afternoon. With a shortcut to the executable in the startup folder, the theme gets applied immediately after logging on to the device based on the local time.

Constant testing is being done and more updates might be on the way :)

Edit: Version 1 is wonky and only works on boot, Version 2 is in progress and will fix that.

If you are interested:
- Download and run the MSI file to install
